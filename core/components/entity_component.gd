class_name EntityComponent
extends Node
## Base class for every behaviour attached to a plant or zombie.
##
## Components are the composition half of the entity model: a Character owns
## its position, health and lane, while everything it *does* - shooting,
## producing sun, eating, exploding - is a component added as a child node.
##
## A mod replaces a behaviour by registering its own script under an existing
## component type name; nothing else in the game needs to know.

var host: Node = null          ## the Character this is attached to
var config: Dictionary = {}    ## the component's entry from the entity JSON


## Called once after the component is attached and `host`/`config` are set.
## Override instead of `_ready` so setup order is guaranteed.
func setup() -> void:
	pass


## Called when the player feeds this entity plant food. Return true if the
## component did something, so the food is only spent when it has an effect.
## Components that have no boosted behaviour simply do not override this.
func on_plantfood() -> bool:
	return false

## Config value with a random jitter applied, for the common
## `interval` / `interval_jitter` pairing. Divided by the host's attack rate,
## so anything that buffs the entity speeds this up without the component
## needing to know a buff exists.

## Config value drawn uniformly from a `key` / `key_max` pair, which is how
## PopCap's {Min, Max} ranges arrive. A key with no `_max` is a fixed value.

## Whether this component takes over the host's attack. A zombie whose attack
## is claimed still stops at whatever blocks it, but deals no bite damage -
## the component does the damage instead, on its own schedule. This is how a
## gargantuar smashes rather than eats without the zombie knowing what a
## gargantuar is.
