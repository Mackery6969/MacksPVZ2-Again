## A mold colony: cells where nothing can be planted for the whole level.
##
## The cells are painted as `mold` terrain, so they look and refuse planting
## the same way any unplantable ground does. A cell that already has terrain
## (water, say) is left as it is.
##
## Config: cells - [{row, col}], 0-based.
